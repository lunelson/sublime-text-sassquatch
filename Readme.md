Sublime Text 2/3 - Sassquatch App Menu plugin
=========================================

Adds a menu item that opens [Sassquatch.app](http://sassquatch.thoughtbot.com/) to preview your current Sass file.

Forked from the [Marked.app plugin](https://github.com/icio/sublime-text-marked) maintained by [icio](https://github.com/icio).

Currently this does not work however, for some reason I can't determine. Whatever.
